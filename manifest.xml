     This package estimates the wrenches exerted at the tip of the 
     PR2 arms through two methods. 

     The first approach uses the joint efforts 
     as input and propagates them forward using the inverse
     of the transposed jacobian.

     The second approach takes the joint velocity errors as inputs 
     and propagates the error forward through the jacobian to 
     obtain the error in the twist of the tip of the arm. This
     error in the twist is a measure of the wrench up to a scale factor.

     Filtered versions of the calculated signals through a Butterworth 
     2nd order LPF are also made available.

     The first method takes the joint efforts from the /joint_states topic,
     while the second needs to have joint velocity controllers loaded.

     The configuration of the root and tip links of each arm are in the
     yaml files located in the config/ directory.
